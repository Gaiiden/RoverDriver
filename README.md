Installation
============

Copy out all txt files to your KSP/Plugins/PluginData/Archive folder once you have installed kOS. If the folder is not there, create it or run KSP once first.


Usage
=====

For details on all the parameters to tweak, see the mod thread:
http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/86177-kOS-12-2P3-Rover-Driver-pre-release

For how to actually use it in the game, first make sure you have read the kOS docs:
http://ksp-kos.github.io/KOS_DOC/

Once in the game with the console loaded, and assuming you've tweaked all variables in the BeginDrive.txt, type the following commands:

> SWITCH To 0.
> COPY BEGINDRIVE TO 1.
> COPY RESUMEDRIVE TO 1.
> COPY MONITORDRIVE TO 1.
> COPY FINISHDRIVE TO 1.
> SWITCH TO 1.
> RUN BEGINDRIVE.

If at anytime you need to edit anything, you can of course use the EDIT command. To abort the program, you can click the Abort button or toggle the Abort action group.
